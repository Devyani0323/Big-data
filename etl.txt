ETL = extract transform load


In the context of AWS, ETL stands for Extract, Transform, Load, a process used to move, clean, and transform data from multiple sources into a single, unified format for analysis and reporting. AWS offers various tools and services to facilitate this process, including AWS Glue, a serverless ETL service. 

Here's a more detailed breakdown:

Extract:
This phase involves gathering data from various sources, such as databases, cloud storage, or other systems.
 
Transform:
Here, the extracted data is cleaned, validated, and formatted to meet specific requirements. This can involve tasks like data cleaning, deduplication, and data type conversions.
 
Load:
Finally, the transformed data is loaded into a target destination, which could be a data warehouse, data lake, or other system for analysis. 



AWS Services for ETL:
AWS Glue:
A fully managed, serverless ETL service that allows users to prepare and load data for analytics. It uses the Apache Spark engine to distribute big data workloads, enabling faster transformations. 
Amazon S3:
Amazon Simple Storage Service, a cloud object storage service, can be used as a source or destination for data in ETL pipelines. 
Amazon Redshift:
A fast, fully managed, petabyte-scale data warehouse service that can be used as a target for loaded data. 
AWS Lambda:
A serverless compute service that can be used to run code for data transformations and loading. 
AWS Data Lake:
A centralized repository for storing large amounts of data in its raw format, which can be used as a source or destination for ETL processes.
